# typeORM_Game_Backend-V2
A typeORM backend built to handle a game of noughts and crosses

For this project I used a Koa server with typeORM to build a backend for a game of noughts and crosses. It was a great way to experiment with typescript and see how best to implement backend validation - I'm definietely a convert to pretty error messages!

TODO:
- Revist the validation library.
- Remove any if/else statements that could be replaced by more robust implementation of @validation.
